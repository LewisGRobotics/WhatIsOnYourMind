# WhatIsOnYourMind
A React app to share whatever is on your mind

Description: This is a toy project I'm using to learn Javascript, more particularly React.js. 
The project is like an anonymous twitter, where you can share a joke / a quote / an idea up to 100 characters, which is sent to a backend database where other people put their own ideas too. Then you're shown a randomized bunch of ideas, with which you will be able to somehow interact in the future (upvote/downvote, reply...?).
